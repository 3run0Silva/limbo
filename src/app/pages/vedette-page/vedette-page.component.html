      <h1>The Unseen Side of the CFF</h1>

        A glimpse into the night operations that keep the Swiss Federal Railways
        running smoothly.

        Most people take for granted the seamless operation of the trains they
        catch every morning. They don’t often realize the extensive work that
        happens during the night to ensure everything runs like clockwork when
        the sun rises. In this article, I’ll take you behind the scenes and
        share what it was like to work during the nighttime hours for the CFF –
        a world where drivers, mechanics, maintenance crews, engineers, and
        guards work tirelessly to keep the system moving.

      <h2>The Start of the Night</h2>
      <p>
        Nights on the job could start as early as midnight or as late as 3 AM.
        The work was meticulously planned out months in advance, with every task
        carefully coordinated. I was part of a specialized team of four, known
        for our expertise and ability to tackle the most challenging tasks. We
        weren’t just cleaners – we were responsible for high-risk jobs that
        required precision and skill, such as cleaning railway tracks and
        performing maintenance in hazardous conditions.

      <h2>The Jobs That Go Unseen</h2>
      <p>
        Our team was often tasked with maintaining the 42 stations from La
        Plaine to Cossonay. We handled jobs that required us to operate heavy
        machinery and work with dangerous chemicals. Whether it was cleaning the
        tracks or scaling heights to clean station windows, we were always ready
        for the task. The jobs we did were crucial for the safety and efficiency
        of the railways, yet they were largely invisible to the public.
      </p>

      <h2>The Human Side of Night Work</h2>
      <p>
        Working nights takes a special kind of dedication. The hardest part
        wasn’t the physical demands of the job, but the isolation. When most
        people are asleep, it’s easy to feel disconnected from the world.
        Maintaining a normal social life was a challenge, but the camaraderie we
        shared as a team made it worthwhile. We were more than just colleagues –
        we were a family, bonded by the unique challenges we faced each night.

      <p>
        Being part of this team was one of the most rewarding experiences of my
        life. We were the unseen heroes, working in the shadows to ensure that
        the trains ran smoothly for the thousands of people who relied on them
        every day. Although our work often went unnoticed, we took pride in
        knowing that without us and others like us, the CFF wouldn’t be able to
        deliver the reliable service it’s known for.
